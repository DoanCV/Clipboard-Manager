# Clipboard-Manager

## Introduction (In Progress - currently deploying to heroku and netlify)
I often find interesting code snippets that I want to store somewhere to later review. In other situations, I may come across useful pseudocode which I would like to study later. However, I often find multiple blocks of code, notes, and text that I want to keep somewhere in an organized manner. I can create multiple files to store content but then I would need to find the files. Note taking applications help with organization but they lack the ability to maintain code snippets and often comes with a paywall. VSCode, a popular IDE, stores snippets but in JSON format which is not very easy to manage. Given that my need is well defined, I decided to build a web application that solves my problem and demonstrates my ability to quickly develop on a new framework using documentation without tutorial.
