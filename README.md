# Clipboard-Manager

## Introduction (In Progress - currently deploying to heroku and netlify)
I often find interesting code snippets that I want to store somewhere to later review. In other situations, I may come across useful pseudocode which I would like to study later. However, I often find multiple blocks of code, notes, and text that I want to keep somewhere in an organized manner. I can create multiple files to store content but then I would need to find the files. Note taking applications help with organization but they lack the ability to maintain code snippets and often comes with a paywall. VSCode, a popular IDE, stores snippets but in JSON format which is not very easy to manage. This web application solves my problem locally. I also want to explore deployment since I am interested in all parts of the development cycle.

Tech stack: MERN web application <br>
MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js


## Demo via Localhost (Currently uploading images)

I tested my application with Microsoft Edge for the developer tools. The network tab was quite useful for server responses and requests. The application tab was great for tracking cookies to identify user login sessions. I also used the React extension to track my components on the frontend. <br>
###### Note: I chose Microsoft Edge since I do like the rewards system for searching as I donate points to charity and exchange points for PC games.
